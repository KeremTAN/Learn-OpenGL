## <b> Aim of This Repository </b>
&nbsp; The aim of this project is to study how 3D computations and linear algebra are implemented in computer science with the OpenGL library.

&nbsp; While I work on the OpenGL library, I do mainly benefit from the OpenGL library introductory training series of Kayhan AYAR, which can be found in the link here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_MhmHNbnhSs&list=PLIM5iw4GHbNW2nleNK5XIvyhZzGiaiBfp.

&nbsp; For example; How to use theory of light in OpenGL or what are the functions used in OpenGL and OpenGL auxiliary libraries and what they do, etc.

##  <b> Summary Information About OpenGL and Auxiliary Libs </b>
&nbsp; <b>OpenGL</b> is a cross platform library that communicates for us with the graphics card so that we can do computer graphics operations.

&nbsp; <b>GLFW</b> is the cross platform library of the OpenGL's auxiliary libraries. The GLFW library communicates between OpenGL and the operating system, it helps us that to manage windows, control input-output operations and similar process in OpenGL.

&nbsp; <b>GLAD and GLEW</b> are cross platform libraries of the OpenGL's auxiliary libraries.
